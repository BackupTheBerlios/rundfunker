Debian GNU/Linux Java FAQ.
<br>Chapter 11 - Other Java alternatives for Debian
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
If the Java packages provided in Debian are not sufficient for your needs you
might need to take a look at other alternatives.  Please understand that these
alternatives are not supported by the Debian project directly, you might get
help, however, from the debian-java mailing list if you encounter issues with
them.

<p>
Some of the alternatives presented use Debian packages which is convenient,
since the user/administrator does not need to care on installation issues.
However, mixing packages that come from a source which is not the Debian
project might cause conflicts with your installation some times.  Of course,
Debian tries to integrate as many free software efforts as possible, so some of
the alternatives described below might (if license permits) be included in
Debian in the near future.

<h2>11.1 How can I get Debian packages from Blackdown?</h2>

<p>
If the releases provided aren't recent enough for you, you can of course
install the files from the Blackdown mirrors.  You can either use the Debian
packages provided by Blackdown or download their tar files.

<p>
(contributed by Federico Mennite) If you want to use their packages, add the
following line [<a href="footnotes.html#f2" name="fr2">2</a>] to your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>:

<pre>
     deb proto://url/debian potato main non-free
     deb proto://url/debian woody main non-free
     deb proto://url/debian testing main non-free
     deb proto://url/debian unstable main non-free
</pre>

<p>
Where <em>proto://url</em> is one of the mirrors from the list available at
<code><a
href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/java-linux-d2.html">http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/java-linux-d2.html</a></code>.
[<a href="footnotes.html#f3" name="fr3">3</a>] For example, in Debian 3.0 using
the main site (in the US) you would use:

<pre>
     deb ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/debian unstable non-free
</pre>

<p>
And then do:

<pre>
     $ apt-get update
     $ apt-get install j2sdk1.4
</pre>

<p>
The packages will download all the library files into
<code>/usr/lib/j2se/</code>, you just need to configure your system to use that
jvm.  If you use these Debian packages you will not need, for example, to
configure your web browser: the symbolic links described in <a
href="ch-browser-java.html#s-netscape-java">Can I use Java in Netscape
6.x/7.x?, Section 8.3</a> for <code>libjavaplugin_oji.so</code> will be
created, as well as the alternative location of <code>/usr/bin/java</code>
pointing to the j2se's Java.

<p>
Note that, at the moment of this writting, there are only Blackdown packages
for <em>unstable</em> and <em>testing</em> of Java 1.4.

<p>
(contributed by Paul Reavis) If you download and install the JDK tar.gz files,
unpack them into <code>/usr/local/jdk1.1.x</code>, and use symlinks to create a
<code>/usr/local/jdk</code> and link in binaries to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>
or whatever.  It is not at all difficult to install these.  However, you can
get segfaults under some conditions depending on your libraries.

<p>
Here is a list of releases that are known to work under each Debian release,
and what other software needed, if any, to make it happen.
<ul>
<li>
rex/bo: 1.1.5v7 (libc5).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
hamm:1.1.5v7 (glibc), also needed latest glibc from <em>slink</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
slink: 1.1.6-test2 (glibc).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.1.1 Making swing work in Debian</h3>

<p>
(from Paul Reavis) [A quickie on getting Swing working under Debian or any
Linux really]

<p>
Yes, it does work with the linux JDK; Swing is 100% Pure Java (tm)(c)(SFD) and
therefore should run under any compliant JVM.  Paul Reavis reported converting
a commercial app (350+ classes) over to a fully-Swing GUI; I've had no problems
so far.

<p>
If you are using jdk 1.1.3 or below, all you need are the class files.  So, the
easiest thing to do is grab the solaris distribution, in tar.Z format, from
javasoft.  Depending on phase of moon, they either call it swing or JFC 1.1 (to
distinguish from 1.2, which is part of Java 1.2).  The current version is Swing
1.0.2 (not to be confused with Java 1.0.2!).  If you are using jdk 1.2.2 do not
download Swing (it is already integrated in the jdk).

<p>
I don't have the archive handy here, so we'll pretend it's named swing.tar.Z.
It is recommended you install it in /usr/local.  So

<pre>
             skronk# cd /usr/local
             skronk# tar xzf /tmp/swing.tar.Z
</pre>

<p>
Now you should have a /usr/local/swing directory.  To test, make sure your
JAVA_HOME variable is set, and CLASSPATH is unset, and run the
&quot;runnit&quot; script in each example.  To be painfully obvious, do this:

<pre>
             skronk$ cd /usr/local/swing/examples/SwingSet
             skronk$ echo $JAVA_HOME
             /usr/local/jdk
             skronk$ unset CLASSPATH
             skronk$ echo $CLASSPATH
     
             skronk$ ./runnit
</pre>

<p>
Of course, your directories, shell prompt, and mileage will vary.  To use with
your own applications, just add the jars you want to your classpath.

<a name="s11.1.2"></a>
<h3>11.1.2 Making Java 2 work in Debian</h3>

<p>
If you wish to use Sun's or Blackdown's jdk 1.2 or later in Debian download the
packages provided by Blackdown (they are available in aptable directories) from
the different mirrors available in <code><a
href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html">http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html</a></code>
(check the debian subdir).  Currently there are i386 packages for the Java2 SDK
and RE, JAI, Java3D and JMF.  This is the recommended mechanism for more
information read <a href="#s-blackdown-pack">How can I get Debian packages from
Blackdown?, Section 11.1</a>.

<p>
<em>Or</em> you can download the archives yourself (that is, the tar.gz, no the
.deb package) and use the following mechanism:
<ul>
<li>
Make a directory under <code>/usr/local</code> (for example
<code>/usr/local/sun</code>).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Download the archine into this directory, then unpack it.  A directory jdk1.X
[<a href="footnotes.html#f4" name="fr4">4</a>] will be created.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Adjust the alternatives to work correctly:

<pre>
        update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/local/sun/jdk1.X/bin/javac 120
        update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java Java /usr/local/sun/jdk1.X/bin/java 120
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Check your alternatives with &quot;type&quot;

<pre>
        type javac
        type java
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should have now a fully working jdk 1.X environment, virtual machine and
compiler included.

<p>
You might need to change your <code>/etc/profile</code> adding the proper
definitions of some environment variables (<samp>CLASSPATH</samp>,
<samp>JAVA_COMPILER</samp> and <samp>JAVA_HOME</samp>) so that Java programs
can find the kit you just have installed.  The following example show which
settings you could add if you had installed Sun's 1.2.2 jdk:

<pre>
     # JDK 1.2.2 (.tar)
     export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/sun/jdk1.2.2/lib:/usr/local/sun/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib
     export JAVA_COMPILER=javacomp
     export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/sun/jdk1.2.2
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sun/jdk1.2.2/bin
</pre>

<p>
Note: As Juergen Kreileder correctly pointed me out The preferred name for
versions &gt;= 1.2 is Java 2 SE (Standard Edition).  The jdk1.3 now is called
&quot;Java2 SDK v1.3&quot; or &quot;J2SDK 1.3&quot;.  The jre1.3 now is called
&quot;Java2 RE v1.3&quot; or &quot;J2RE 1.3&quot;.

<hr>

<a name="s11.2"></a>
<h2>11.2 How can I integrate Sun's J2SE SDK with Debian Testing?</h2>

<p>
Warren Dodge explains how this can be done for Debian testing: the first step
is to download the J2SE SDK components from <code><a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html</a></code>
into, e.g.  <code>/var/install/java/1.4.2</code>.  Make sure that you have
write permission to the directory, and make the installer executable.  Running
the installer <code>./j2sdk-1_4_2_02-linux-i586.bin</code> will create a
directory <code>j2sdk1_4_2_02</code> which can be moved to
<code>/usr/local/lib</code>.  Next, create a link <samp>ln -s
/usr/local/lib/j2sdk1_4_2_02 /usr/local/lib/jdk</samp> which allows you to use
the latter location to refer to the Java environment and makes upgrading a lot
easier in the future.

<p>
Because Debian does not have an installer packages for Sun's J2SE, a dummy
package needs to be made to let Debian know that a J2SE is installed.  This is
done as follows.  Use the 'dummy' package control files provided by
<code>java-common</code> to satisfy dependencies:

<pre>
     mkdir -p /var/install/java/pkg
     cd /var/install/java/pkg
     cp /usr/share/doc/java-common/dummy-packages/*.control .
     equivs-build java-compiler-dummy.control
     equivs-build java-virtual-machine-dummy.control
     equivs-build java1-runtime-dummy.control
     equivs-build java2-compiler-dummy.control
     equivs-build java2-runtime-dummy.control
</pre>

<p>
You should now have five packages in /var/install/java/pkg which should be
installed.

<p>
The command <code>update-alternatives</code> is used in Debian to choose which
of several pacakges to use when several can do the same thing.
(&quot;Java&quot; can also be provided by kaffe, Blackdown (see above), etc).
See &quot;man update-alternatives&quot; for more details.  Use this command to
install the programs you need with commands like:

<pre>
     update-alternatives --verbose --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/local/lib/jdk/bin/java 500 \
       --slave /usr/share/man/man1/java.1 java.1 /usr/local/lib/jdk/man/man1/java.1
</pre>

<p>
Run java once as root to allow system preference directories to be created and
to check if Sun's <code>java</code> is working properly:

<pre>
       java -version
</pre>

<hr>

<a name="s11.3"></a>
<h2>11.3 How can I integrate Sun's J2SE SDK with Debian Stable?</h2>

<p>
The procedure is similar to the one described for Debian Testing (above).
However, the java-common in stable does not have the *.control files.
Therefore, you need to install the java-common package from testing or
unstable.  Versions 0.19 and 0.20 can be safely be installed and require the
installation of the equivs package, but the one from stable is just fine.

<p>
Notice, however, that newer J2SE versions (notably 1.4.2_04 instead of
1.4.1_02) might depend on newer libc6 or libgcc1 libraries.  If you cannot
backport (recompile) this package to your libraries you will need are limited
to using jdk 1.3.1-11 (which requires libstdc++2.9-glibc2.1 from the
<em>oldlibs</em> section).

<h2>11.4 Java programs not yet available on Debian</h2>

<p>
The following are programs that have not yet been packaged for Debian nor is
there an installer.  There are quite a lot Java programs out there and this
list is not an exhaustive list, it only includes programs that <em>might</em>
be packaged for Debian or those that someone is working on an installer for:
<ul>
<li>

<h2>11.5 Installer packages</h2>

<hr>

<a name="s-installer"></a>
<h3>11.5.1 What Java programs have an installer?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<code>vajava</code> is a visual IDE for Java.  You can find it in <code><a
href="http://software.ibm.com/ad/vajava">http://software.ibm.com/ad/vajava</a></code>.<em>TODO:
check copyright</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ibm-jdk1.1</code>.  Installer for IBM Developer Kit for Linux, Java(TM)
Technology Edition.  It will install an alpha version 1.1.6 of the IBM
Developer Kit.  The IBM Developer Kit is a development environment for writing
applets and applications that conform to the Java 1.1 Core API.  Its compiler
and other tools are run from a shell and have no GUI interface.

<p>
The IBM Developer Kit includes the IBM JIT (libjitc.so) which is used by all
tools by default.  Look for it in <code><a
href="http://master.debian.org/~doko">http://master.debian.org/~doko</a></code>.
Needs to be upgraded to 1.1.8.  However it seems that providing an installer
might break their license (see <a href="ch5.html#s-ibm-jdk1.1">IBM's jdk1.1,
Section 5.3.2</a>)
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<code>jdk1.2-installer</code>.  Look for it in <code><a
href="http://www.pobox.com/~julio/debian/jdk1.2-installer/">http://www.pobox.com/~julio/debian/jdk1.2-installer/</a></code>.
This one works for the pre-release version, a little work is needed in order to
install the release candidate version.  (Update, April 2000, the link seems to
be broken, anyone has one?)
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="s11.5.2"></a>
<h3>11.5.2 What Java programs could I develop an installer to?</h3>

<p>
An important installer that is missing is an installer for Sun's J2SDK 1.4
series.

<p>
Some others are:
<ul>
<li>
<code>jdk-1.2.2</code> SE Standard Edition <code><a
href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/download-linux.html">http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/download-linux.html</a></code>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<code>jbuilder3</code>.  A Java IDE from Inprise (written in java) <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.inprise.com/pub/jbuilder/jb3foundation/sol_linux/">ftp://ftp.inprise.com/pub/jbuilder/jb3foundation/sol_linux/</a></code>.
Works well.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<code>netbeans</code>.  Another Java IDE (also written in java) <code><a
href="http://www.netbeans.com/">http://www.netbeans.com/</a></code> for writing
bean based GUI apps.
</li>
</ul>
