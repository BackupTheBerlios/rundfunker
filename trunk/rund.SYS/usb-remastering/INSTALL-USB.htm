<BODY><PRE>:: How to boot L.S.A from a USB Flash drive ::

::Step 1)
Get your USB drive booting:-
Download syslinux http://syslinux.zytor.com/faq.php (don't trust the 
syslinux that came with your favorite Linux distro it's probably been 
tampered with)
Insert your USB drive.
Work out where it has been attached to /dev (look in dmesg for a hint) - 
probably /dev/sda or /dev/sda1
Make a directory in mount for your drive.

mnt\&gt;mkdir usbdrive

mount it and get a disk free to make sure you have the right device

mnt\&gt;mount -t [vfat/msdos] /dev/sda* /mnt/usbdrive
mnt\&gt;df

Unmount it before you make it bootable.

mnt\&gt;umount /mnt/usbdrive

make it bootable
\&gt;/home/syslinux/syslinux [-s] /dev/sda*

reboot

::Step 2)
Enter your BIOS and set the first boot device to USB ZIP
If this isn't an option in your BIOS download and flash your BIOS with the 
latest version. Still not an option - only thing todo is make a boot floppy 
and keep all the other files on the USB :(

Boot the machine and you should see the start of a Syslinux boot
It will stop with an error. Turn your machine off and remove the drive.

[if it didn't start to boot then either :-
	1) you need to put the USB drive into a root usb port or your BIOS may time 
out before it finds the drive
	2) your usb drive doesn't have a cluster size that will boot syslinux 
(there are 2 many different drives out there for me to help you with this 
;google your way out of it)
	3) if all else fails do a search for "runt" &amp; "usb" on google to look for 
another method to boot from USB involving dd if=xxx.mbr of=/dev/usbdrive
]

::Step 3)
Start Linux up again, insert your USB drive, mount it.
insert your L.S.A cd and mount it
\&gt;mount -t iso9660 /dev/hcd /mnt/temp    (assuming /dev/hcd is your cdrom &amp; 
you must mkdir /mnt/temp first)

copy over the KNOPPIX directory to the USB drive
copy the moded miniroot.gz and other files onto the root of the USB.

Unmount the loop back remove the cd and reboot
\&gt;umount /mnt/temp

\&gt;reboot

If you can't get it going send an email usb[at]localareasecurity.com
