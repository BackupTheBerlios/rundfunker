Operating Envilonment and How to use the Control Programs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These control programs work on the Win32 envilonment. The programs are console
application as follows:

program_name -<switches> <hex files> ...

These programming tools have a nice feature that it can detect device type
automaticaly and operates with suitable programming parameters according to
the detected device type. Therefore, only prepareing hex files written to
the device is sufficient. Specifying the device type is not needed to use
these programming tools.




PARALLEL PROGRAMMING WITH HIGH-VOLTAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this programming mode, avrpp.exe is used as a control program. When the
control program is executed, a messege that request to mount a device will be
displayed. Then put a device on the socket and type Enter key, the programming
operation will start. These instruction shuould be followed because the device
might be damaged due to state of the programmer is unknown until control
program is executed. When program 8, 28 or 40 pin devices with parallel
programmer, a socket converter for the device is required. (see also html
document)


  -r       Device test. Display only device type.
  -rp      Read program code and output it to STDOUT in Intel-Hex format.
  -re      Read EEPROM data and output it to STDOUT in Intel-Hex format.
  -rf      Read fuse values and output it to STDOUT.

  -v       Skip erase and program operation and only following verify
           operation is performed.

  -l[<bin>] Lock device.

  -e       Chip erase. This will unnecessary because erase operation is also
           performed before programming the program memory.

  -fl<bin> Program fuse low byte. The fuse byte are specified in binary
           value <bin>.
  -fh<bin> Program fuse high byte.
  -fx<bin> Program fuse extended byte.

  -pc<n>   Specify the COM port number to use. COM1 is used in default.
  -pl<n>   Specify the LPT port number to use.

  -8       Force device auto-detection as 8 pin device.
  -5       Force device auto-detection as tiny15.

  -c       Copy calibration byte into end of program memory when programming
           into program flash memory is performed. (Refer to tips_e.txt)



Example 1: Write prog1.hex and table1.hex into program memory, and prog1.eep
           is written into data EEPROM. Long file names can also be used.

  >avrpp prog1.hex table1.hex prog1.eep


Example 2: Program fuse low byte. Bit[3:1] in the fuse byte is programmed (0)
and any other bits are unprogrammed (1). The fuse byte is specified with a
binary number following -f{l|h|x} switch.

  >avrsp -fl11110001
            ~~~~~~~~

Example 4: Read program memory or EEPROM, and save as a Intel-Hex file.

  >avrsp -rp > file.hex
  >avrsp -re > file.eep

Read data is output to the STDOUT in Intel-Hex format. When any line
(32 bytes) is filled with 0xFF, the line will be eliminated. When you wish to
get it into a file, redirect the output into any file.




SERIAL DOWNLOADING VIA AN LPT/COM port
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this mode, avrsp.exe is used as the control program. Execute the control
program after connect the ISP cable to the terget board and turn on the target
power. The control program also supports LPT port controlled CPLD/FPGA
programming adapter for Xilinx, Lattice and Altera device. When use this
programmer instead, the connection between the JTAG signals and AVR are:
TDO-MISO, TDI-MOSI, TCK-SCK and TMS-RESET.

Available switchs are shown in follows:

  -r       Device connection check. Display only the device property.
  -rp      Read program code and output it to STDOUT in hex format.
  -re      Read EEPROM data and output it to STDOUT in hex format.
  -rf      Read fuse data and output it to STDOUT.

  -v       Skip erase and program operation and only following verify
           operation is performed.

  -v-      Skip verify operation when any memory programming is performed.

  -l[<bin>] Lock device. When the value is ommited, a defalut lock value that
           programs both lock bits is used.

  -e       Chip erase. This is usually unnecessary because the chip erase
           operation is also performed when programming the program memory.

  -fl<bin> Program fuse low byte. The fuse bits are specified in a binary
           number. When use this function, you should enter the fuse value
           with care, or the device might become impossible to access in ISP
           mode due to the wrong fuse setting.
  -fh<bin> Program fuse high byte.
  -fx<bin> Program fuse extended byte.

  -pc<n> -pl<n> -pv<n> -pb<n>[:<bps>]
           Specify which port is used to program. The default value is -pc1
           (COM1 direct I/O), second one is for LPT<n> in direct I/O, therd
           one is for COM<n> port via API and last one is for COM<n> port
           with an SPI bridge. Last two does not require any direct I/O dirver
           on the NT based OSs, and some USB-RS232 converter may able to be
           used (but -pv takes about 100 times longer then real COM port).

  -c       Copy calibration bytes into end of the program memory when any
           programming into the program flash memory is performed. (Refer
           to tips_e.txt)

  -d<n>    Specify I/O delay for communication timing between PC and the
           target device. This switch will be unnecessary for most
           envilonments. However, when the device is running at slow clock
           (less than 1 MHz) or PC's I/O cycle time is too fast, any error
           will occure. In this case, -d20..100 will able to solve this
           problem. When the device is running at fast clock (faster than
           6 MHz), -d0 reduces the programming time. The default value is 3.

  -t<dev>  Force deivce type. This will be effective when the device type
           cannot be detected due to any reason.
           e.g. -t90S1200 -ttiny26 -tmega128

  -z       Output a test signal on the SCK in pulse period of 1 msec. This
           will help to examine the compatibility of windows timer service.



Example 1: Write prog1.hex, table.hex and prog1.eep. .hex files are written
into the program flash, .eep files are written into the EEPROM.

  >avrsp prog1.hex table.hex prog1.eep


Example 2FWrite only EEPROM data. In this case, chip erase operation is not
performed, so that the data on the program memory will be retained.

  >avrsp data1.eep


Example 3: Program fuse high byte. Bit 0,1,6 and 7 in the fuse byte is
programmed ("0"), others are unprogrammed ("1"). The fuse data is specified
with a binary value following -f{l|h|x} switch. Please refer to fuse.txt and
the device data sheet for each fuse function. The bit values indicated in
hyphen are masked out but they must be 1 or 0. Leading zeros can be omitted.

  >avrsp -FH111100
            ~~~~~~


Example 4: Read program flash memory or EEPROM, and save it as a hex file.

  >avrsp -rp > file.hex
  >avrsp -re > file.eep

Read data is output to the <stdout> in intel-hex format. When any line
(32 bytes) is filled with 0xFF, the line will be eliminated. When you wish to
get it into a file, redirect the output into any file.


Example 5: Multiple command execution

  >avrsp -fl111100 -fh11110 -l file.hex file.eep ...

      Write commands can be used at one time. This will effective when program
      RSTDISBL fuse and Lock bit with ISP mode. The command execution priority
      is independedt of order in the command line, and they will be executed
      in order of Flash, EEPROM, Fuse bytes and Lock byte. When there is any
      overwrap between the hex files, right one overwires left one.




HOW TO LOCK A DEVICE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To lock device, only -l switch is sufficient for most application, both lock
bits LB1 and LB2 in the lock byte will be programmed. However, if you wish to
change boot lock bits, the lock byte must be specified like fuse bits.
For details on the boot lock bits, refer to particular data sheets.




COMMUNICATING VIA AN ISP CABLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The COM port controlled serial programming adapter (ISP cable) can be used to
communicate between the host PC and the target device. This will be useful for
debugging, actual use, and so on.
After the firmware is programmed, the ER signal of the COM port goes high when
terminal program opens the COM poet and the target reset is released, and the 
target promram will start.
The target program configure MISO as output, MOSI as input and communicate in
software implimented UART. In this case, the ports are connected to COM port
with out inverted buffer, such as RS-232C drivers, so that the porality is
inveted (L=mark, H=space). For more informaiton on the software implimanted
UART, please refer to sample code included in AVRMON.ZIP.





Error Messages
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control progams may stop with an error message when any error occured.
Each error message, its cause, and work around are shown in follows:

<file name> : File access failure
---------------------------------
The file is not exsist or any error occured.


<file name> (<line#>) : Hex format error
----------------------------------------
Any error is detected during loading the hex file.


Writing...Time out at AAAA
--------------------------
A polling time out is occured during byte programming.


Verifying...Failed at AAAA:WW-RR
--------------------------------
A verify error is detected.


Unknown device (<h>-<h>-<h>)
----------------------------
The device ID is not valid. Three hexdecimal values are read ID values.
It can think about the following case.
- The device is not supported in this version yet.
- Target power is off.
- The device is not clocked. (ISP mode)
- Any communication error occured due to the SPI speed. (ISP mode)
- ISP funciton is disabled due to any reason. (ISP mode)


Locked device or Synchronization failed.
----------------------------------------
Locked device is not writable. (only ISP mode) Please perform chip erase
with -e command. This error can also occure due to any communication error.


No COM<n>(0xXXX) port.
No LPT<n>(0xXXX) port.
COM<n> could not be opend.
Invalid Port#.
--------------------------
Specified port was absent or invalid for the port class. The correspondence
of the port number and the physical address is determined in constant table.
(Refer to hwctrl.h)


I/O driver initialization failed.
---------------------------------
A direct I/O driver (giveio.sys) is required but it was not served.
This occures at only WindowsNT/2k/XP. (Refer to differ_e.txt)
