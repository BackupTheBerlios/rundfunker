AVRPP/AVRSP - AVR Programming tools for Win32
							   November 11, 2004


AVRSP is an AVR serial programming tool that was re-written as a Win32
application that combined MS-DOS based AVRXS and AVRSS. AVRPP is Win32
version of MS-DOS based AVRXP. Their function and usage are equivalent as
those MS-DOS programs. This document explains only changes from the MS-DOS
based programs.



Command Line Option

 The switch character for the command line option was '/' on MS-DOS version.
 But it has been changed to '-' on Win32 version.


Control Port (AVRSP)

 AVRSP supports COM port and LPT port to control ISP adapters.
 The port number for AVRSP is specified as follows:

 ExamplesF -pc1 (COM1, default)
            -pl1 (LPT1)


Fuse write command

 The fuse value format for write command is changed from hexdecimal to
 binary. Reserved bit "-" is masked out but it must be 0 or 1 in command
 line. Leading zero can be ommited.

 DOS version:    /fl36
 Win32 version:  -fl110110


Relationship between port number and I/O address

 I/O address for the control port was got form BIOS work area. But Win32
 programs determin the physical I/O address in constant table. (Refer to
 hwctrl.h)


Supported input file format

 Also Motorola S record is supported. AVRSP/AVRPP can read these format even
 if the Intel-hex and the Motorola S record are mixed into a file.


Using AVRSP/AVRPP on the Windows NT/2k/XP

 When use the programs in direct I/O access on the these OSs, GIVEIO is
 required to get permission of direct I/O access. If the GIVEIO has been
 registerd to SCM database and started, avrsp/avrpp can be used without any
 setup instruction. If not, you have to get GIVEIO.SYS and copy it into any
 directory (%windir%\system32 will do), and use avr?p.exe, GIVEIO will be
 registered at the same time. In this case, you have to have logged in as
 an administrator user in order to access the SCM.

>move giveio.sys %windir%\system32
>avrsp -r

 Wnen any message other than "GIVEIO initialization failed" is displayed,
 the GIVEIO has been installed successful.


I/O delay (AVRSS/AVRXS/AVRSP/AVRPP)

 Small value for I/O delay option (-d) reduces read/write time, but operating
 clock frequency of the target device restricts minimum value of the I/O
 delay option.

 >4MHz   -d0
 >1MHz   -d3    (default)
  32kHz  -d200


Programming Language

 Programming language is changed from asm to c. You can use the source files
 without any restriction for migration to any other platform or research.
